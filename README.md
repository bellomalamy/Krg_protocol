KRG – Kinetic Relay Grid v0.1  
Offline State Synchronization Protocol (OSSP)  
By Bello Malami Muhammad– 2025

KRG introduces a new protocol category: an Offline State Synchronization Protocol (OSSP) designed to preserve digital trust even when the internet is unavailable.

KRG enables devices to:
- Create state transitions offline  
- Exchange them via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, NFC, QR, etc.  
- Relay them through multi-hop "store–carry–forward" paths  
- Validate and verify trust fully offline  
- Finalize truth through a delayed reconciliation process  

KRG is not a blockchain.  
KRG is not DTN.  
KRG is not a mesh network.  

KRG is a new class of communication protocol for offline digital trust.


Why KRG Exists
Today, digital systems fail instantly without connectivity:

- Identity cannot be verified  
- Payments cannot be completed  
- Certificates cannot be checked  
- Aid distribution collapses  
- Elections pause  
- Governance stops  

KRG solves this by enabling cryptographically verifiable digital operations offline.

Core Concept: SCP (State Change Packet)

At the heart of KRG is the State Change Packet (SCP)
